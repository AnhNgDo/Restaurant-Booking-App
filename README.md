# Restaurant-Booking-App
This repo contains the code for a basic full-stack restaurant booking web app - based on Meta's full stack capstone project.

# What does the app do?
- allow users to make restaurant booking
- bookings are allowed only if the time slot is available (open hours, not booked by someone else)
- all bookings are stored in a transactional database

# Technical component
- front end -> Django's template + JavaScript
- application logic -> booking APIs
- database -> MySQL
